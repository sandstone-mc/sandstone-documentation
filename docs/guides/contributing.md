- [Sandstone CLI](https://github.com/sandstone-mc/sandstone-cli) - Tool for creating projects, handling dependencies, and running the builder.
- [Sandstone Build](https://github.com/sandstone-mc/sandstone-build) - Independent library implemented for web & node consecutively that builds the files of your project.
- [Sandstone Libraries](https://github.com/sandstone-mc/sandstone-libraries) - Officially distributed/maintained libraries to extend functionality not present in the base library.

If you want to implement a feature or fix a bug, thoroughly examine surrounding & similar systems and figure out how they work, then use them as an example. If you need help the existing maintainer(s) will help you.

# Website

This website is the documentation for the [Sandstone](https://github.com/sandstone-mc/) project. It is hosted on [sandstone.dev](https://www.sandstone.dev).

### Installation

```
$ pnpm i
```

### Local Development

```
$ pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=true pnpm deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
